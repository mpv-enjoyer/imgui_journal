# imgui_journal

- ImGui::BeginCombo(...) modified to calculate width better

- jcombo is meant to replace original combo to calculate MAX value width.

- main.h file is dumb and needs to be renamed

TODO:
- [IMPORTANT] Right now all the month info is coming from current time --> switching month doesn't actually change anything in the journal itself.
- All_Students button, which will allow to add, edit and hide students. (make sure that hidden students will appear in read-only mode in the journal)
- Workouts.
- All_Groups.
